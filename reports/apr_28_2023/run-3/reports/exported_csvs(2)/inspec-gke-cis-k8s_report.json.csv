inspec-gke-cis-k8s_report.json,Failed,cis-gke-4.3.2-network-policies-and-cni,[NETWORK-POLICIES-AND-CNI] Minimize the admission of privileged containers,"Do not generally permit containers to be run with the securityContext.privileged flag
  set to true.","default: Do not generally permit containers to be run with the securityContext.privileged flag
  set to true.

rationale: Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and devices. A container
  running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists
  to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices.
  There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
  privileged containers.
  If you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you
  should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and
  users are given permission to access that PSP.
